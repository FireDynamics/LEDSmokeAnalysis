# LEDSmokeAnalysis

TODO:

make LED class with id, coordinates (in pixel and xyz-space), array label 

Configfile:
	- eichtime
	- coordinates of line endpoints
	- 
	
Folder structure

Time from meta data -> compare with eichtime -> find experiment time

Hough transformation -> get lines

find xyz-space (from plane) (median of all cameras? seems complicated if leds are not labeled the same[missing led from one angle])
