# LEDSmokeAnalysis (LEDSA)

LEDSA (LEDSmokeAnalysis) is a Python-based software package for the computation of spatially and temporally resolved light extinction coefficients from photometric measurements. The method relies on capturing the change in intensity of individual light sources due to fire-induced smoke. Images can be acquired within laboratory experiments using commercially available digital cameras.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.8
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation from PyPI

The easiest way to install LEDSA is via pip:

```bash
python -m pip install ledsa
```

### Installation from Source

To install LEDSA from source:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FireDynamics/LEDSmokeAnalysis.git
   cd LEDSmokeAnalysis
   ```

2. Install the package:
   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```

## Usage

LEDSA can be used via its command-line interface (CLI). The general structure is:

```bash
python -m ledsa [ARGUMENT] [OPTIONS]
```

### Configuration

Create a default configuration file:
```bash
python -m ledsa -conf
```

Create an analysis configuration file:
```bash
python -m ledsa -conf_a
```

### Main Workflow

The typical workflow consists of three main steps:

1. **Step 1: Find LEDs on a reference image**
   ```bash
   python -m ledsa -s1
   ```

2. **Step 2: Assign LEDs to LED arrays**
   ```bash
   python -m ledsa -s2
   ```

3. **Step 3: Analyze light intensity changes among different images for the RGB color channels**

   ```bash
   python -m ledsa -s3_fast -rgb
   ```

4. **Calculate 3D coordinates of the individual LEDs**
   ```bash
   python -m ledsa -coord
   ```

5. **Run computation of extinction coefficient**
   ```bash
   python -m ledsa --analysis
   ```

For a complete list of options, run:
```bash
python -m ledsa --help
```

## Demo

LEDSA includes a demo that demonstrates its functionality using sample data.

### Setting Up the Demo

The demo setup will download approximately 5GB of data from the internet:

```bash
python -m ledsa --demo --setup /path/to/demo/directory
```

This will create two directories:
- `image_data`: Contains the sample images
- `simulation`: Contains configuration files and results

### Running the Demo

After setting up the demo, you can run it:

```bash
python -m ledsa --demo --run
```

By default, the demo uses 1 core. You can specify more cores:

```bash
python -m ledsa --demo --run --n_cores 4
```

## Contributing

To introduce new, tested, documented, and stable changes, pull/merge requests into the master branch are used.

Pull request drafts can be used to communicate about changes and new functionality.

After reviewing and testing the changes, they will be merged into master.

Every merge with master is followed by introducing a new version tag corresponding to the semantic versioning paradigm.
